# Numpy
NumPy (short for Numerical Python) is a powerful open-source Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# Creator

NumPy was originally created by Travis Oliphant in 2005 as an extension of the older Numarray and Numeric libraries.

# Key Features

**N-dimensional arrays**: NumPy introduces powerful arrays that allow you to work with data in one or more dimensions efficiently.<br>
**Vectorized operations**: NumPy allows for fast and efficient operations on entire arrays at once, eliminating the need for explicit looping.<br>
**Broadcasting**: NumPy's broadcasting allows arrays with different shapes to be operated on together.<br>
**Mathematical and statistical functions**: NumPy includes a variety of functions for linear algebra, statistics, and random number generation.<br>
**Interoperability**: NumPy arrays can be easily integrated with other libraries such as SciPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.<br>
**Performance**: NumPy is implemented in C and uses optimized BLAS and LAPACK libraries for fast mathematical computations.<br>
**Slicing and indexing**: NumPy offers flexible slicing and indexing capabilities that allow for accessing sub-arrays and elements of an array.<br>
**Array manipulation**: Functions for reshaping, stacking, splitting, and joining arrays are included.
